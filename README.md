## Auto Class

An Obsidian plugin to automatically apply CSS classes to the markdown preview view as if you had added them in a `cssClasses` YAML key, based on a note's path. Combine this with CSS snippets targeting a CSS class and you can have different snippets applied to different paths in a single vault without having to add any HTML or CSS classes yourself.

### Use

Classes are applied based on a note's path. In settings, configure a folder path and the classes to apply to the children of that folder.

Once configured, the next time the view is updated the classes will be applied.
